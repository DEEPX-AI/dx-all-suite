## Question #1

When running the `dx-runtime` or `dx-modelzoo` container using the `docker_run.sh` script, the container stays in a **Restarting** state, and you cannot execute `docker exec -it <container-name> bash`.

```bash
$ ./docker_run.sh --target=dx-runtime --ubuntu_version=24.04
```

```plaintext

```

```bash
$ docker exec -it dx-rumtime-24.04 bash
```

```plaintext
Error response from daemon: No such container: dx-rumtime-24.04
```

## Answer #1

First, check if the **dxrtd** (dx-runtime service daemon) is already running on the host system:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep dxrtd
```

```plaintext
root       60451  0.0  0.0 253648  6956 ?        Ssl  10:52   0:00 **/usr/local/bin/dxrtd**
```

If **dxrtd is already running on the host**, the attempt to run `dxrtd` inside the Docker container will fail, causing the container to enter a **restart loop**.

Check the container status with:

```bash
$ docker ps 
```

```plaintext

```

```bash
$ docker logs dx-runtime-24.04 
```

```plaintext

```

### Solution 1:

**Stop the `dxrtd` service running on the host**, then rerun the `docker_run.sh` script so that `dxrtd` runs **only inside the Docker container**.

Refer to the installation guide [Link](/docs/source/installation.md#run-the-docker-container) for more details.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dxrt.service
./docker_run.sh --target=dx-runtime --ubuntu_version=24.04
```

### Solution 2:

Keep `dxrtd` running **on the host**, and **prevent it from running inside the Docker container**.

Refer to this guide [Link](/docs/source/installation.md#4-if-you-prefer-to-use-the-service-daemon-running-on-the-host-system-instead-of-inside-the-container) for configuration instructions.

## Question #2

### Q2.1 When running `docker_run.sh`, the following warning message may appear:
```
[WARN] it is recommended to use an **X11 session (with .Xauthority support)** when working with the 'dx-all-suite' container.
```

### Q2.2 After a system reboot or session logout, the container failed to restart due to the following issue: `error mounting /tmp/.docker.xauth`.

Example error message:
```
Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting "/run/user/1000/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.N9UI62" to rootfs at "/tmp/.docker.xauth": create mountpoint for /tmp/.docker.xauth mount: cannot create subdirectories in "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/00690e188f08ad4bad24fbc8786b00653e76b44f32d9b88b1ae5ed1e2d7654c8/merged/tmp/.docker.xauth": not a directory: unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type
Error: failed to start containers: dx-runtime-22.04
```

## Answer #2

The `dx-all-suite` Docker container uses **X11 forwarding** to display GUI windows when running sample applications or example code. For this, it relies on `xauth` to manage authentication.

However, if the user's host environment is not based on **X11 (with .Xauthority)** but instead uses **Xwayland** or similar, the `xauth` data may be lost after a system reboot or session logout. As a result, the authentication file mount between the host and the container may fail, making it impossible to restart or reuse the container.


Therefore, it is recommended to use an **X11 session (with .Xauthority support)** when working with the `dx-all-suite` container.

You can resolve this issue by setting **X11 as the default session**, as described in the instructions above.

### Set X11 as the Default Session

To make X11 the default session (and disable Wayland), modify the GDM configuration file.

#### For GNOME (Ubuntu-based systems):

1. Open the GDM configuration file with root permissions:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```

2. Find the following line and uncomment it (remove the #), or add it if it doesn't exist:

```conf
WaylandEnable=false
```
3. Save the file and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X in nano).

4. Restart the GDM service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart gdm3
```

After reboot or GDM restart, the system will use the X11 session by default instead of Wayland.
