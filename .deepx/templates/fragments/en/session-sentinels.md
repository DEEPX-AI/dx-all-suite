## Session Sentinels (MANDATORY for Automated Testing)

When processing a user prompt, output these exact markers for automated session
boundary detection by the test harness:

- **First line of your response**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]`
- **Last line after ALL work is complete**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <relative_path>)]`
  where `<relative_path>` is the session output directory (e.g., `dx-agentic-dev/20260409-143022_yolo26n_detection/`)

Rules:
1. **CRITICAL — Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]` as the absolute first line of your
   first response.** This must appear before ANY other text, tool calls, or reasoning.
   Even if the user instructs you to "just proceed" or "use your own judgment",
   the START sentinel is non-negotiable — automated tests WILL fail without it.
2. Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <path>)]` as the very last line after all work, validation,
   and file generation is complete
3. If you are a **sub-agent** invoked via handoff/routing from a higher-level agent,
   do NOT output these sentinels — only the top-level agent outputs them
4. If the user sends multiple prompts in a session, output START/DONE for each prompt
5. The `output-dir` in DONE must be the relative path from the project root to the
   session output directory. If no files were generated, omit the `(output-dir: ...)` part.
6. **NEVER output DONE after only producing planning artifacts** (specs, plans, design
   documents). DONE means all deliverables are produced — implementation code, scripts,
   configs, and validation results. If you completed a brainstorming or planning phase
   but have not yet implemented the actual code, do NOT output DONE. Instead, proceed
   to implementation or ask the user how to proceed.
7. **Pre-DONE mandatory deliverable check**: Before outputting DONE, verify that all
   mandatory deliverables exist in the session directory. If any mandatory file is
   missing, create it before outputting DONE. Each sub-project defines its own mandatory
   file list in its skill document (e.g., `dx-build-pipeline-app.md` File Creation Checklist).
8. **Session export guidance**: Immediately before the DONE sentinel line, output
   the appropriate session-save instruction based on the CLI platform:

   | Platform | Command | Format |
   |----------|---------|--------|
   | **Copilot CLI** | `/share html` | HTML transcript |
   | **Cursor CLI** (`agent`) | No built-in export — session is saved automatically by the test harness via `--output-format stream-json` | JSON stream |
   | **OpenCode** | `/export` | JSON |

   For Copilot CLI, output: `To save this session as HTML, type: /share html`
   For OpenCode, output: `To save this session as JSON, type: /export`
   For Cursor CLI, no user action is needed — the test harness captures output automatically.

   The test harness (`test.sh`) will automatically detect and copy exported artifacts
   to the session output directory.
